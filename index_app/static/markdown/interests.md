My general research interest is to develop deep learning algorithms for challenging computer vision and multimedia problems. 
Recently, I focus on:

- Weakly supervised object detection and semantic segmentation
- Video analysis, including detection and tracking
- Multi-label classification
- Multi-modal analysis
